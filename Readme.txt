I try to rebuild that driving game from Code Bullets "AI Learns How To Drive" Video. 
That Video was actually my motivation to get into Coding at all. 
I never coded Javascript before. 
I just had a little html basics , but I didnÂ´t use them since MySpace sucks. 
I found out that the bits of code you can see in that Video are not working. 
But at least I achieved to get that car moving up and down by my self. 
The next things I want to find out is how to Rotate/Turn the car, 
how to make a speedlimit and a boarder inside the canvas. 

I would be glad if someone shows and explain me some of the basic code that is needed.
